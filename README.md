Music History Version 7. (Curriculum section 30-music-history-07)

My work this weekend will focus on tying together most of the elements we've learnt so far to prepare for group work on Monday. This README.md is intended for my own Action Research and practice creating documentation.

This is an extra effort to put together all the music-history elements we've learnt so far. 

Coding work is focused on:

	Bootstrap
	Handlebars*
	Require
	Promises*

* - likely issues

Moqups and Trello will be used to make an attempt to learn practice project management.
An attempt will be made to consistently use GitHub. 


History:
Sat. 11/14/2015 11:40- Git push the readme.
11:50 - Explored Moqups, googled potential page layout styles. List on Wikipedia.
	-Allmusic style - acceptable. Vertical blocks. Also use top-bar navigation.
	-Several music lists resemble Wikipedia.
	-Librivox.org may benefit from finished work.
		~page purpose is as follows:
			* Librivox Page allows users to filter list of available readings and add to a personal Wishlist.  
			* View Music page (now View Readings) will be already uploaded texts. 
			* Add Music page (now Add Readings) will be two things:
				>Add Readings to be read
			* Filter criteria becomes: 
				>Title 
				>Author
				>Language
				>Reader
			* Future use: Better individual profile for volunteer readers than currently available. Other features would be required.

Sat. 11/14/2015 12:30 - 
	Initial Moqup is bare bones. Additional elaboration difficult without more thorough grounding in Bootstrap. Git update README.md. Begin exploring Trello.

	Complications with Moqups:
	Initial moqup too simple.

Sat. 11/14/2015 1:00 Lunch Break! 2:00

Sat. 11/14/2015 2:10 - 
	Boarding past the template stage is very challenging. I'm moving on to accomplishing the tasks at hand, then I'll go back to the board to decide on the next set of steps. Push new README. 

	Complications with Trello:
	Added additional Moqup ideas while deciding Trello boarding. Moved back and forth.
	Unknown complications with Git. (Needed to specifically - "git add README.md" - not "git add .")

Sat. 11/14/2015 2:20 
	Begun Trello checklist. 
		Moqup ideas continue.
		Rethinking naming conventions.
			nameOfCard--nameOfSection(if applicable)--nameOfIndividual
				Cards:
					nav (bootstrap), library, wishlist, addbook

		Minor Moqup alterations.
3:05 - preliminary HTML set up. HTML Indentation and Comments finished.
	Forgot to consider renaming the files. Naming the files THEMSELVES is just as important as naming what's in the files. Doh.

3:15 -
	Gruntfile runs.
3:20 -
	Redundant, useless files eliminated. Working copies and examples only remaining.

Sat. 11/14/2015 3:25 Break to change location. Chik-Fil-A staff annoyed.
Sat. 11/14/2015 4:00 Return home. Set up. Start on operable template.
	Bootstrap rows and columns work. (Therefore require working)
Sat. 11/14/2015 5:02 Handlebars template operating. Although uncertain precisely 	why. Still need to get Promises and LoDash working. Git up. Break. 


Sun. 11/15/2015 10:30 Back to work. Reviewing Promises from Promises-JAM in-class project to work with LoDash and Promises.
